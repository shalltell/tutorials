# Tech Tutorials 

### Description

This is a collection of tutorials and techniques I find while sleuthing the web. Saving them here because my bookmark game is a hoarded mess of links and recipes. 

The `[a]` at the end of the links are for the archived versions, in case the live links stop working.
